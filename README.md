# Python Battleship Game üó∫Ô∏è

Battleship is a classic grid-based strategy game where the player competes against the computer by guessing the locations of its hidden fleet of ships. The objective is to sink all of the computer's ships within a limited number of turns.

## Game Instructions

1. In this game, you'll try to sink a fleet of ships hidden on a grid by guessing their positions.
2. You'll have a limited number of turns to guess their locations, and the game will show you whether your guess was a hit, miss, or a duplicate guess.
3. To make a guess, enter the row and column of the cell you want to target.
4. Good luck!

## Scoring

Players earn points for each successful hit. The points earned for a hit depend on the type of ship hit and the ship's size. The top 10 players' scores will be displayed on the scoreboard.

## Improvements

1. Add screenshots or a GIF of the game in action to make the README more visually appealing and help users understand the gameplay better.
2. Include a section on how to install and set up the project in different environments (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
3. Provide a link to a video demonstration or a tutorial for users who prefer visual explanations.
4. Add a "Frequently Asked Questions" section to address common questions or issues that users might face.
5. Include a "Known Issues" or "Troubleshooting" section to help users resolve problems they may encounter.
6. Add a "Roadmap" or "Future Plans" section to outline upcoming features and improvements to the game.
7. Include a "Contributors" section to acknowledge and thank contributors to the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required

## Customization

To customize the game settings, you can modify the fleet configuration, grid size, and number of turns in the `main()` function of the `battleship.py` file. The default settings are as follows:

- Easy: Grid size of 5x5, fleet consisting of a destroyer (2 cells), cruiser (3 cells), and battleship (4 cells), and 10 turns.
- Medium: Grid size of 7x7, fleet consisting of a destroyer (2 cells), cruiser (3 cells), battleship (4 cells), and aircraft carrier (5 cells), and 15 turns.
- Hard: Grid size of 10x10, fleet consisting of a destroyer (2 cells), cruiser (3 cells), battleship (4 cells), aircraft carrier (5 cells), and an additional aircraft carrier (6 cells), and 20 turns.

To customize the game further, you can adjust the ship points, ASCII art, or instructions displayed during the game.
